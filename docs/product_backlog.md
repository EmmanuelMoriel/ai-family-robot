# Product Backlog

Each story follows this format:  
**As a [user], I want [functionality], so that [benefit].**

---

## Epic 1: Core Robot Framework
- As a developer, I want to configure the Jetson board to handle camera, microphone, and motor interfaces.  
- As a developer, I want to build a local server (FastAPI) for command processing.  
- As a user, I want the robot to start, connect to Wi-Fi, and be ready to interact.

---

## Epic 2: Navigation and Environment Awareness
- As a user, I want the robot to move around the house safely without colliding with objects.  
- As a developer, I want to integrate sensors (e.g., LiDAR, ultrasonic, or camera-based SLAM) for spatial awareness.  
- As a user, I want the robot to recognize specific rooms (living room, kitchen, etc.) so it can navigate on command.  
- As a user, I want the robot to return to a charging station automatically when battery is low.

---

## Epic 3: Speech and Voice Assistant
- As a user, I want to speak to the robot naturally and receive voice responses.  
- As a developer, I want to implement wake-word detection and speech-to-text capabilities.  
- As a user, I want the robot to answer questions or execute voice commands like “play music” or “what’s the weather?”.

---

## Epic 4: Vision and Emotion Recognition
- As a user, I want the robot to recognize each family member’s face.  
- As a user, I want the robot to detect my emotions (happy, sad, tired) to adjust its behavior.  
- As a developer, I want to process camera input in real time using optimized models on Jetson.  
- As a user, I want the robot to greet family members by name.

---

## Epic 5: Companion and Interaction Module
- As a parent, I want the robot to engage my children in conversations and simple games.  
- As a user, I want the robot to recommend activities based on my emotional state (e.g., music if sad).  
- As a developer, I want to create a dialogue engine that balances empathy and utility.

---

## Epic 6: Learning and Adaptation
- As a user, I want the robot to remember my preferences and daily routines.  
- As a developer, I want to log interactions and retrain lightweight models locally or in the cloud.  
- As a user, I want the robot to personalize greetings, tones, and responses for each family member.

---

## Epic 7: MLOps and Cloud Integration
- As a developer, I want to automate model updates via CI/CD and cloud deployment pipelines.  
- As a user, I want the robot to improve over time without manual updates.  
- As a developer, I want to store model versions, logs, and analytics securely in the cloud.

---

## Epic 8: User Interface and Mobile Integration
- As a user, I want a mobile app or web dashboard to see robot status, battery, and sensor data.  
- As a parent, I want to monitor the robot’s interactions with my children.  
- As a developer, I want a secure backend API that syncs robot data with the dashboard.
