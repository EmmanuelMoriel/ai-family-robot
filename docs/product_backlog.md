# Product Backlog

Each story follows this format:  
**As a [user], I want [functionality], so that [benefit].**

---

## Epic 1: Core Robot Framework
- As a developer, I want to set up the Jetson development environment so I can build and test AI modules.

- As a developer, I want to design a modular project structure to support scalable development.

- As a developer, I want to implement base ROS or MQTT communication for components to exchange messages.

- As a system integrator, I want to implement safety and error-handling mechanisms to maintain stable operation.

---

## Epic 2: Navigation and Environment Awareness
- As a robot, I want to perceive and map the simulated environment using LiDAR or virtual sensors.

- As a user, I want the robot to autonomously navigate around obstacles in the simulation.

- As a developer, I want to visualize navigation paths and environment maps in real time.

- As a user, I want to define "rooms" or zones for context-aware behavior.

---

## Epic 3: Speech and Voice Assistant
- As a user, I want the robot to understand simple spoken commands.

- As a user, I want the robot to respond with natural voice using text-to-speech.

- As a developer, I want to integrate NLP APIs for intent recognition.

- As a parent, I want the robot to recognize different family members by voice profile.

- As a user, I want the robot to recognize individual voices so it can respond personally.

---

## Epic 4: Vision and Emotion Recognition
- As a robot, I want to detect human faces in real-time to identify family members.

- As a robot, I want to recognize emotions (happy, sad, neutral, angry) so I can adapt my behavior.

- As a user, I want the robot to react empathetically based on emotional context.

- As a developer, I want to optimize real-time inference on Jetson hardware for performance.

- As a robot, I want to store and update emotion history per user to learn emotional patterns.

---

## Epic 5: Companion and Interaction Module
- As a parent, I want the robot to engage my children in conversations and simple games.  
- As a user, I want the robot to recommend activities based on my emotional state (e.g., music if sad).  
- As a developer, I want to create a dialogue engine that balances empathy and utility.

---

## Epic 6: Learning and Adaptation
- As a user, I want the robot to remember my preferences and daily routines.  
- As a developer, I want to log interactions and retrain lightweight models locally or in the cloud.  
- As a user, I want the robot to personalize greetings, tones, and responses for each family member.

---

## Epic 7: MLOps and Cloud Integration
- As a developer, I want to automate model updates via CI/CD and cloud deployment pipelines.  
- As a user, I want the robot to improve over time without manual updates.  
- As a developer, I want to store model versions, logs, and analytics securely in the cloud.

---

## Epic 8: User Interface and Mobile Integration
- As a user, I want a mobile app or web dashboard to see robot status, battery, and sensor data.  
- As a parent, I want to monitor the robot’s interactions with my children.  
- As a developer, I want a secure backend API that syncs robot data with the dashboard.

---

## Epic 9: Hardware & robot design
- As a designer, I want to define the robot’s physical form.  
- As an engineer, I want to select motors, servos, and sensors compatible with Jetson.  
- As a designer, I want to prototype the body using 3D modeling or printed parts.

---

## Epic 10: Physical integration & testing
- As an engineer, I want to integrate the Jetson hardware and sensors into the body.  
- As a tester, I want to validate navigation and emotion detection in real environments.  
- As a developer, I want to fine-tune AI models for real-world lighting and sound.
